# spiced_petition
## An online petition (with a yt-video bg)


## About

This project was built during my attendance to the Spiced Academy's Web Development Bootcamp in Cologne.

This is an online petition made with Node/Express and Handlebars. Users can register/login, edit their personal profile and sign with their signature (canvas). 
After signing, they can see a list of other users who have signed the petition. 

Theme: Make the Eurovision Song Contest a National Holiday!

## Why this?

I found building this App very useful as my very first component-based project to get used and comfortable working with components and passing props between parent and children. It was also very useful to learn the concept of mounting within a component.

## Technologies I used

- HTML5, CSS3
- Handlebars
- Node/Express
- PSQL

## Set Up

Clone it in your local directory in the terminal run it with 
`node .`. 

You will need to create a secrets.json for cookieSession's keys.
